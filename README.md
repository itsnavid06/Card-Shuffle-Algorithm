# Card-Shuffle-Algorithm
This algorithm performs a card shuffle on a list of 2n elements. The list is split into two 
halves, L1 and L2. The shuffle is performed by interweaving elements from the two lists such that we 
would start with the first element from L1, followed by the first element of from L2, then the second 
element from L1, the second element from L2, and so on. Ultimately this process combines the two lists 
and performs the shuffle. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n) and no additional lists of any kind 
are used more than O(1) cells.
